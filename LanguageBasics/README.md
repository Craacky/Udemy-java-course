# Java Basics Homework

This project contains solutions to three Java programming exercises.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Array Search

1.  Read a number from the console to determine the size of an integer array.
2.  Create an integer array of the specified size.
3.  Fill the array with random numbers using the `Random` class.
4.  Read a second number from the console to search for within the array.
5.  Iterate through the array using a `foreach` loop to check if the second number exists.
6.  Print a message to the console indicating whether the number was found.

### Task 2: Find Maximum Value

1.  Given an array of numbers, find and return the largest value in the array.

### Task 3: Simple Calculator

1.  Implement a simple calculator using a `switch-case` statement.
2.  Read two numbers from the console.
3.  Prompt the user to select an operation:
    -   `1`: Addition
    -   `2`: Subtraction
